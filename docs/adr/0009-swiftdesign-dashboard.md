# ADR 0009: Compile SwiftDesign into the embedded dashboard

Status: accepted for the redesign branch, 2026-11-05.

The requested UI replacement uses SwiftDesign Vue components and SwiftConfig as the
visual template. The previous no-build vanilla page cannot consume those components.
Use Vue, Vite and Tailwind for build-time authoring, retaining the standard-library Go
server and single distributable binary. Authentication and actions remain Go APIs.

Use pinned package snapshots with provenance until a portable package distribution is
established. Commit production output under web/dist so Go-only builds still work;
frontend edits regenerate that output. The asset handler serves only known embedded
production files, with immutable caching for fingerprinted assets and no-store HTML.

A cosmetic CSS port would not use the requested components. A separately deployed
frontend would complicate host setup and the current same-origin authentication contract.
Neither is used. Shared presentation packages do not grant permissions or own host data.

Project detail navigation follows SwiftConfig's host flow while the global menu stays global.
Resource grouping is a read-only join over existing inventories. For VM worktree grouping,
the backend emits a hash of the resolved recipe root only for a unique mapping; the checkout
catalog emits the same key. This avoids exposing VM discovery paths or treating an incomplete
browser catalog as proof of unique ownership. Shared/ambiguous claims remain unassigned at
worktree level. The key grants no lifecycle capabilities and is never an action target.
