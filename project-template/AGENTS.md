# Agent notes

This project runs on a devkit host: the app and its services run in Docker, one
preview per Git worktree, at a private HTTPS URL on the tailnet. The host may not
have the project's language or tools installed; the containers do.

Keep the "Previews with devkit" guidance when adapting this project. Update "This
project" as the app changes; additional project instructions can follow below.

## Previews with devkit

- Work in your own worktree and run every `devkit` command from it. devkit acts on
  the current worktree's preview; never act on another worktree's.
- Run project commands (tests, linters, migrations, package managers, scripts) in
  the container: `devkit exec <command...>`, or `devkit exec -s <service> ...` for
  another Compose service (e.g. the database). Files it writes belong to you.
- `devkit exec` needs this worktree's live preview. If it says there is none, run
  `devkit live`; it prints the preview URL. Starting a live preview is fine whenever
  you need one.
- The live preview mounts the worktree's files, so edits show up as the app's own
  reload allows. It does not rebuild images: after changing a Dockerfile, dependencies
  or Compose files, ask before running `devkit destroy` then `devkit live`, because
  destroy deletes the preview's data.
- Read logs with `devkit logs` (the last 200 lines). Never use `devkit logs -f`: it
  does not return.
- To hand work over for review: commit, then run `devkit review HEAD`. It builds from
  the committed files only, so uncommitted changes are not in it. Report the URL it
  prints and the full commit SHA.
- `devkit ls` lists previews and their URLs; `devkit history -n 10` shows what devkit
  did recently, including failures.

Ask first, and only do when asked:

- `devkit destroy`, `devkit gc --yes` and `devkit prune --yes`: they delete data or
  affect the whole host.
- `devkit share`: it makes a preview public on the internet.
- `devkit publish`: it deploys to the team.

Never:

- run `docker`, `docker compose` or the app directly on the host to get around devkit;
- publish ports, set `container_name` or `network_mode` in Compose files, or put
  host secrets into an image;
- create or remove worktrees, or commit, push or merge, unless asked (devkit only makes the initial commit during explicit project creation);
- fix the host yourself (Traefik, DNS, certificates, `devkit setup`). Report what
  `devkit doctor` says instead.

When editing Compose files: every service needs a health check and named volumes; the
review file uses the built image (`${DEVKIT_IMAGE}`) with no `build:` and no source
mounts. `DEVKIT_URL` is the preview's URL; while shared, the web service also gets
`DEVKIT_PUBLIC_URL`. Hooks (`prepare`, `check`, `build`, `publish`) live in
`devkit.json`.

## Development credentials with Devkit

Use the devkit-secrets skill whenever creating, generating, saving or using development usernames, passwords or API tokens. Store credentials through Devkit's integrated vault so the human can find and copy them in this project's Secrets tab.

- Run from the intended project checkout. Check `devkit secrets context --json` and `devkit secrets list --json` before creating credentials; reuse suitable existing entries instead of silently replacing them. Follow the skill for registration or context mismatches.
- Save a username and its password together as a login entry (`--type login`) with a descriptive key such as `dev-admin`, not the username. Standalone passwords and API tokens remain single-value secrets. Do not silently combine or delete existing entries.
- Choose an explicit scope. Use worktree scope for temporary checkout credentials; choose branch or project scope only when sharing is intended. Worktree overrides branch, which overrides project. Never modify an inherited parent merely to create a local override.
- Generate and store passwords with `devkit secrets generate`; send existing values through protected stdin or hidden prompts. Follow the skill for paired-login input and explicit username/password environment mappings.
- Use `devkit secrets run` for runtime injection. Never put credential values in chat, Git, recipes, command arguments, logs or permanent dotenv files. Report only the entry name, scope and location in the Secrets tab.
- Saving or rotating a vault entry does not create or update the application's account. Apply credentials to the application only within the authorized task, and verify without printing them.
- Preserve existing Git/T3/agent workflows. Cleanup retention is configurable, including never and automatic off; do not change cleanup settings or delete credentials as an incidental step.
- If the vault is sealed or unavailable, report it and ask the human to restore access. Never fall back to plaintext storage or read host backend tokens, root tokens or unseal material.
