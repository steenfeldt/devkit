# Acceptance check

1. Create a Git repository from the sample and commit it.
2. Create worktrees for branches `try/a` and `try-a` (e.g. `git worktree add -b try/a ../try-a`);
   verify distinct names/URLs.
3. Start both live previews. Change each `message.txt`; verify different responses.
4. Increment one preview's counter; the other must stay unchanged.
5. Commit one task; run `devkit review HEAD`. Change its live message again; the
   review must keep the committed message.
6. Increment the review counter, stop/start it, and verify the count persists.
7. Open the same URLs from another computer on the tailnet. Disconnect the first client; agents and
   previews should continue on the Linux host.
8. Configure the publishing adapter and complete one team review on your destination.

Local validation commands: `go test ./...` and `bin/devkit --help`. Full runtime acceptance requires a Docker daemon,
the Linux host, real domain/DNS settings and a configured publishing destination.

The Docker-only check can run with `DEVKIT_RUNTIME_TEST=1 python3 tests/runtime_acceptance.py`.
It uses temporary repositories and containers with loopback-only test HTTPS,
does not issue certificates or alter DNS, and removes its test containers/volumes.
The media check is `DEVKIT_RUNTIME_TEST=1 python3 tests/media_acceptance.py`; it
requires local Tailscale, creates temporary UDP/TCP echo previews, checks distinct
ports and restart persistence through the tailnet IP, and cleans them up.


Project discovery and QEMU regression tests run with `go test ./...`. They cover
shallow directory discovery, external linked worktrees, recipe validation, Docker
failure and rejection of arbitrary or removed launch paths.
Git control tests use disposable local bare origins and clones, without contacting
project remotes. They cover fetch-only, fast-forward sync, separate exact-target push,
dirty/detached/diverged branches, ignored-file preservation, upstream validation, in-progress operations, repository
locks, pre-push hook rejection, discovery revalidation and anonymous action denial.
Build `bin/devkit`, then run `python3 tests/git_runtime_acceptance.py` for the actual
authenticated dashboard job → CLI → local Git round trip (or set `DEVKIT_GIT_BINARY`
to an alternate build). It uses temporary credentials and stubbed Docker housekeeping,
and removes its server and disposable repositories afterward.
Container inventory tests cover managed/unmanaged metadata, stopped/paused status, secret
omission and Docker failures. These run in `go test ./...`.

For UI changes, exercise the Projects Git controls and Containers tab using synthetic
fixtures: signed-in/out states, action targets, text/status filters, empty/error/recovery,
Details/Logs availability, tab deep links and narrow viewports. Never test Git actions
against a user's project merely to validate the UI.

Installer behavior is
checked without sudo, package installation, or host changes by
`python3 tests/bootstrap_acceptance.py` (mocked Ubuntu/Fedora commands, architecture
profiles, existing daemon preservation, repeated group setup and failures).

Build the binary, then run `DEVKIT_VM_RUNTIME_TEST=1 python3 tests/vm_runtime_acceptance.py`
for the optional x86_64 QEMU smoke check. It needs `qemu-system-x86_64` with SPICE and
`qemu-img`. It creates two paused, 64 MiB TCG guests with no OS, one with a temporary
32 MiB qcow2 disk and SPICE, the other with a localhost SSH forwarding listener.
It verifies real process discovery, sizes, connection commands, metadata privacy
project mapping (including an unmatched guest), and `/api/vms` CPU sampling. Its temporary web server stubs Docker to isolate
background cleanup from real containers. It terminates only its own processes and
removes its temporary files. This does not test a booted guest login or graphical
session; those need an existing test guest and client. Libvirt parsing, access
failure and deduplication are covered by fixtures; live libvirt validation needs
an active domain visible to the devkit account.

### VM lifecycle acceptance

Build the binary, then run `DEVKIT_VM_RUNTIME_TEST=1 python3 tests/vm_lifecycle_acceptance.py`.
It creates a temporary paused 64 MiB TCG guest and project launcher, verifies
start/idempotence/restart/stop, failed-stop protection, stopped inventory and
unchanged disk contents, and cleans up its own QMP socket/guest. It never uses a
real user's VM. `DEVKIT_VM_BINARY` can select a test binary outside the checkout.
The no-OS fixture uses QMP quit; production adapters must use graceful guest shutdown.
Go tests cover local libvirt command arguments/state handling, missing/denied
providers, conflicts, lifecycle locking and authenticated dashboard target checks.

QEMU cleanup regressions cover exact name/project selection, dry-run and --yes, blocked
batches, missing stop/purge authority, retained files, adapter failures/timeouts, changed
identities/recipes, symlink rejection, legacy recipe names, unrelated JSON preservation,
lifecycle locking and partial-success history. The lifecycle acceptance runner also
starts its disposable guest for named and project cleanup, checks retained disk hashes,
and verifies --purge removes only its explicitly configured fixture files. No real
user guest or disk is used.


### Native resource shutdown

Build the binary, then run:

```sh
DEVKIT_SHUTDOWN_RUNTIME_TEST=1 DEVKIT_TEST_IMAGE=YOUR_LOCAL_IMAGE \
  python3 tests/resource_shutdown_acceptance.py
```

Choose an existing image with `/bin/sh` and `sleep`; the test never pulls images.
`DEVKIT_VM_BINARY` can point at an alternate build. This creates one isolated Docker
container/volume and a small disposable ACPI-aware QEMU/TCG boot guest. The guest
handles the virtual power button and exits itself. The test checks both VNC/SPICE,
authenticated actions, missing confirmation, actual graceful exit, unchanged disk and
recipe hashes, retained container data/volume, history and inventory refresh. Docker
visibility and mutation are restricted to the exact fixture ID; optional providers are
stubbed. Cleanup removes only test-created resources. Set `DEVKIT_SHUTDOWN_UI_READY`
to a temporary descriptor path to pause for browser testing; create that path plus
`.continue` afterward. Its generated password is test-only; do not publish descriptors.
